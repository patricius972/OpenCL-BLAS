OpenCL BLAS
===========

This project is meant to become a CBLAS compatible implementation of BLAS 
routines on OpenCL devices. The focus will be on compatibility and performance
to get the whole power of your OpenCL device.

This project is in a very early stage and some tests have to be made to decide
some architectural questions. If you are interested in contributing to this
project with expertise and programming, please contact me at:
